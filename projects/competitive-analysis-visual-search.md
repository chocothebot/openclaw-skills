## Market Trends

### 1. Chat-to-Shop is the New UX
Both Daydream and Phia lead with conversational interfaces. Users describe what they want in natural language, then refine through dialogue. This is where product discovery is heading.

### 2. Gen Z Drives Adoption
Visual-first shopping is generational. Younger shoppers expect to point their camera at something and find it (or something like it) instantly.

### 3. Vertical Depth > Horizontal Breadth
Google Lens is everywhere but shallow. Specialized players (Daydream for fashion) are winning on quality. **This is Dupe's opportunity in furniture + home goods.**

### 4. Privacy is a Battleground
Phia's data controversy shows users are paying attention. Transparent, privacy-respecting approaches can be a differentiator.

### 5. AR Integration Coming
Expect visual search + AR try-on/visualization to merge. Especially relevant for furniture (see it in your room) and fashion (virtual try-on).

## Dupe's Strategic Position

### Your Strengths
1. **Custom models** trained on furniture, home goods, fashion — domain expertise
2. **Multi-vertical** — not locked into fashion-only
3. **Technical depth** — CTO-led, model-first approach
4. **Azure credits** — $100k to scale infrastructure

### Potential Differentiators
1. **Best-in-class furniture/home visual search** — Daydream and Phia are fashion-focused
2. **Privacy-first positioning** — capitalize on Phia's missteps
3. **B2B + B2C hybrid** — offer API to retailers while building consumer brand
4. **Price-quality transparency** — "dupe" finding is your brand (finding similar items at better prices)

### Questions to Consider
- Is Dupe consumer-facing, B2B, or both?
- What's the monetization model? (Affiliate, subscription, API licensing?)
- Do you compete with Daydream/Phia directly or carve out furniture/home niche?
- Partnership opportunities with Syte, ViSenze, or retailers?
